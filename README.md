# PyF1
Predefined tools and graphs for F1 telemetry and laptime statistical analysis based on Fast-F1 by theOehrly. It uses data provided by FastF1 and builds it into plots or some metrics that gives some insight into F1 races. You can find some scripts with race analysis that I have prepared.  

## Important Notice
Project currently compatible with fastf1 2.1.11

## Intro
This project is started by motor racing enthusiast that on some day has decided to test his abilities in reverse engineering car performance. By no way am I a programmer, just a curious mechanical engineer with some basic knowledge about data analysis and python. I am just having fun and learning.
